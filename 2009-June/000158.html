+ZLIB DATA COMPRESSION LIBRARY
+
+zlib 1.2.3 is a general purpose data compression library.  All the code is
+thread safe.  The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs
+(Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files
+<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt</A> (zlib format), rfc1951.txt (deflate format)
+and rfc1952.txt (gzip format). These documents are also available in other
+formats from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/documents/zlib/zdoc-index.html">ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/documents/zlib/zdoc-index.html</A>
+
+All functions of the compression library are documented in the file zlib.h
+(volunteer to write man pages welcome, contact <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/netpanzer-cvs">zlib at gzip.org</A>). A usage example
+of the library is given in the file example.c which also tests that the library
+is working correctly. Another example is given in the file minigzip.c. The
+compression library itself is composed of all source files except example.c and
+minigzip.c.
+
+To compile all files and run the test program, follow the instructions given at
+the top of Makefile. In short &quot;make test; make install&quot; should work for most
+machines. For Unix: &quot;./configure; make test; make install&quot;. For MSDOS, use one
+of the special makefiles such as Makefile.msc. For VMS, use make_vms.com.
+
+Questions about zlib should be sent to &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/netpanzer-cvs">zlib at gzip.org</A>&gt;, or to Gilles Vollant
+&lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/netpanzer-cvs">info at winimage.com</A>&gt; for the Windows DLL version. The zlib home page is
+<A HREF="http://www.zlib.org">http://www.zlib.org</A> or <A HREF="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">http://www.gzip.org/zlib/</A> Before reporting a problem,
+please check this site to verify that you have the latest version of zlib;
+otherwise get the latest version and check whether the problem still exists or
+not.
+
+PLEASE read the zlib FAQ <A HREF="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib_faq.html">http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib_faq.html</A> before asking
+for help.
+
+Mark Nelson &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/netpanzer-cvs">markn at ieee.org</A>&gt; wrote an article about zlib for the Jan. 1997
+issue of  Dr. Dobb's Journal; a copy of the article is available in
+<A HREF="http://dogma.net/markn/articles/zlibtool/zlibtool.htm">http://dogma.net/markn/articles/zlibtool/zlibtool.htm</A>
+
+The changes made in version 1.2.3 are documented in the file ChangeLog.
+
+Unsupported third party contributions are provided in directory &quot;contrib&quot;.
+
+A Java implementation of zlib is available in the Java Development Kit

+
+An experimental package to read and write files in .zip format, written on top
+of zlib by Gilles Vollant &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/netpanzer-cvs">info at winimage.com</A>&gt;, is available in the
+contrib/minizip directory of zlib.
+
+
+Notes for some targets:
+
+- For Windows DLL versions, please see win32/DLL_FAQ.txt
+
+- For 64-bit Irix, deflate.c must be compiled without any optimization. With
+  -O, one libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit mode (with the -n32
+  compiler flag). The compiler bug has been reported to SGI.
+
+- zlib doesn't work with gcc 2.6.3 on a DEC 3000/300LX under OSF/1 2.1 it works
+  when compiled with cc.
+
+- On Digital Unix 4.0D (formely OSF/1) on AlphaServer, the cc option -std1 is
+  necessary to get gzprintf working correctly. This is done by configure.
+
+- zlib doesn't work on HP-UX 9.05 with some versions of /bin/cc. It works with
+  other compilers. Use &quot;make test&quot; to check your compiler.
+
+- gzdopen is not supported on RISCOS, BEOS and by some Mac compilers.
+
+- For PalmOs, see <A HREF="http://palmzlib.sourceforge.net/">http://palmzlib.sourceforge.net/</A>
+
+- When building a shared, i.e. dynamic library on Mac OS X, the library must be
+  installed before testing (do &quot;make install&quot; before &quot;make test&quot;), since the
+  library location is specified in the library.
+
+
+Acknowledgments:
+
+  The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz. The deflate
+  and zlib specifications were written by L. Peter Deutsch. Thanks to all the
+  people who reported problems and suggested various improvements in zlib;
+  they are too numerous to cite here.
